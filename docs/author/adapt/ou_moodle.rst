Adapting Open University Moodle Content
===============================================

This describes the process and scripts Digital Campus has used to adapt content from the Open University (UK), for 
example the HEAT and OpenWASH content.

This content is already very well structured and edited, however there are a few areas that need to be updated so the 
courses display very well on OppiaMobile.

#. Import the Moodle course onto your own Moodle server - you will need to have full access to the Moodle installation 
   and database for this adaptation.
   
#. Updating and applying the scripts that we used for the HEAT content adaptation. These remove OU specific stylesheets 
   and navigation. [Describe each script below and what function it performs]

#. Apply more general stylesheet, for example for the in-text questions, notes, warnings - using the same icons etc used 
   for the mobile adapted HEAT content.
   
#. Review of images and tables - to ensure they are resized/styled appropriately for display on mobile

#. Adding activity icons/images

#. Adapt SAQs into Moodle quiz format - not all SAQ questions may be able to be adapted (depends on the complexity and 
   type of question)

#. QA check and review - the QA will focus on the layout/consistency of stylesheets/images/tables etc, but will not look 
   at the actual content, spelling/grammar etc (as assume has already been very well reviewed for these aspects)
