OppiaMobile App Permissions
===========================


In the OppiaMobile client (phone) app generally all users have the same functionality 
and permissions. The only difference is those users who are teachers who can the 
monitoring pages directly within the app. For admin and staff users to see these 
monitoring pages, they need to be explicitly assigned the teacher role in the 
appropriate cohorts and courses.


Earning points
--------------

In the default settings:

* Admins and staff users do not earn points or badges for their activity in 
  courses.
* Teachers do not earn points or badges in the courses they are teachers on
* If non admin or staff users are given permissions to upload courses, then they
  will not earn points or badges in the courses they upload.

These defaults may be changed in the server settings.
