Upgrading to OppiaMobile Server v0.11.0
===========================================

In OppiaMobile Server v0.11.0, the project has been restructured, and there is
a simplified installation process.

To upgrade to this version, you should first:

* Install the new dependencies, run ``pip install -r django-oppia/requirements.txt``
* Migrate the database, run ``python manage.py migrate``
* Cache the static files, run ``python manage.py collectstatic``

Then review the 
`Server - Manual Installation <https://oppiamobile.readthedocs.io/en/0.11.0/technical/install/server.html>`_ 
and make any necessary updates to your configuration, especially checking:

* creating a ``settings_secret.py`` file (see item 2 in the install docs), and 
  transferring over any settings you may have had in ``local_settings.py`` to 
  this file.
* running the tests and that the server runs locally (items 6 and 7 in the 
  install docs) 
* updating Apache webserver configuration file (item 8 in the install docs) 
* updating how the cron commands are run (item 9 in the install docs)
