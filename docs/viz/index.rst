Visualizations
===============

Creating visualisations of the data in OppiaMobile is a work-in-progress, 
currently there are 2 main visualisations available:

Summary Overview
----------------
This gives a one-page overview of the activity on your OppiaMobile server and 
can only be access by users with the is_staff status. The summary overview page 
gives graphical representations of:

* User Registrations
* Activity by Country
* Course Downloads
* Course Activity

User Map
--------
This shows a map of the locations of the users and activity on your OppiaMobile 
server. Please note that by default this map shows the users from the 
http://demo.oppia-mobile.org server. To see a map of the users on your server, 
you will need to configure this, see the :ref:`user map setup instructions<usermap>`.
