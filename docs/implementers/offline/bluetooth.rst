Using Bluetooth to transfer between devices
============================================

Bluetooth can be used to share course content and media files directly between
devices.


Basic/example Workflow
--------------------------

#. Course content is updated or new courses are added, with new/updated media 
   files.
#. A supervisor or project staff member downloads the updated course/media 
   content onto their device, when they are in an area with internet 
   connection, or by sideloading the updated content.
#. When the supervisor visits their health workers in an area where no internet
   connectivity is available, they can synchronise the updated course/media 
   content from the supervisors device onto the health workers device, using 
   the bluetooth ``sync`` option in the main OppiaMobile menu.
#. This will move all the new/updated content and media onto the health workers
   device.
#. The health worker could then also share these updates in the same way with 
   her colleagues.
