Troubleshooting OppiaMobile App
=====================================



Course doesn't show up in the app course download list
-------------------------------------------------------

* The course is marked as archived on the Oppia server. If a course is marked as archived, then it will not appear for 
  any user in the app. Check that the course is not marked as archived on the server.
* The course is marked as draft on the Oppia server. If a course is marked as draft then only admin/staff users will be 
  able to view it in the app. Either log in to the app as an admin/staff user, or remove the draft status from the 
  course in the server.
* The course has not been given any tags when being published. To view the course in the download courses part of the 
  app, each course must be given at least one tag when it has been published. If a course is updated and re-published, 
  then the tags must be given again (the original tags should be pre-filled in the course publishing form).
