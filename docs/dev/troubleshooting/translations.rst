OppiaMobile uses the in-built Moodle functionality for authoring courses in multiple languages.

For troubleshooting translations it is best to start trying to fix a single page.

The `Moodle documentation <http://docs.moodle.org/en/Multi_language_content>`_ has some information on how to 
fix common problems. 

One additional problem we have noticed, is using mismatching single or double quotes in the HTML tags
