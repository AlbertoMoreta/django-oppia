OppiaMobile Development Roadmap
=================================


* Better management of quizzes and questions (internal)
* Integration with messaging platforms (e.g. WhatsApp, Telegram)
* Integration with data collection platforms (eg OpenSRP) - being able to launch particular 
  learning activities within the data platform, then also being able to match up 
  data/accounts from Oppia and external platforms.
* Embedding more interactive/graphical questions - eg with drag and drop
* Improved teacher/supervisor tools
* Adaptive learning content and quizzes
* Restricting course access to particular users - for example where Oppia may be used for paid courses
* Improved gamification and linking up to OpenBadges
* Linking up to xAPI and learning record store
