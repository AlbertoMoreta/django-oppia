Moodle Block Installation
==========================

There are 2 main methods for installing the OppiaMobile Export Moodle Block, 
depending on how you are able to access your Moodle server.

Full server admin rights on your Moodle (eg. if you 'own' the server)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* This would be the preferred approach
* Clone the GitHub repository `https://github.com/DigitalCampus/moodle-block_oppia_mobile_export` 
  into your `moodle/blocks/` directory
* You'll need to rename the generated directory `moodle-block_oppia_mobile_export` to be just `oppia_mobile_export`
* Visit the admin notifications page on your Moodle server to trigger installing the block 



Local rights for your Moodle installation (eg on shared hosting)
------------------------------------------------------------------
