Using Video Content in OppiaMobile Courses
===========================================

When a user installs a course containing video content, the actual videos aren't
included in the course download content. The reason for this is that video files 
tend to be very large and users on slow connections are unlikely to be able to 
download large video files.

If a course contains video files that aren't available on the users phone, on 
the app homepage a message will appear that some video/media content is missing.

How to embed video files in OppiaMobile courses
-------------------------------------------------


How can users get the video files
----------------------------------

There are two options for getting the video content onto users phones:

#. Download the video/media files directly onto the users SD card. This is most 
   likely the best option for projects which are providing phones to users as 
   the video files can be pre-loaded
#. Download via the app. When the app flags up that a video file is missing, 
   then the user can download directly to their phone. This is only likely to be
   feasible to users who are connected to wifi. So by default users will only be 
   able to download video files directly if they are connected to a wifi network. 
   This can be over-ridden in the app settings to allow downloading of video 
   files by allowing downloading using cellular network.
